INTRODUCTION                                    *pushd*

Like pushd, popd, and dirs in your shell? Now you can do the same thing in
vim.

I wrote this to have a nice, small script to use pushd and popd in vim. There
are other plugins for this, but they are fairly large, and depend on other
plugins.

COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-pushd*

:Pushd [args]           Add current directory to the stack, and change to the
                        new directory. If no directory is specified, change
                        directory to the home directory.

:Popd                   Change to the previous directory on the stack.

:Dirs                   Print the directory stack.
